Finding "Pages You Might Like"
We've officially reached the final milestone of our first data science project at CodeBook – The Social Media for Coders. After cleaning messy data and building features like People You May Know, it's time to launch our last feature: Pages You Might Like.

Why This Matters
In real-world social networks, content discovery keeps users engaged. This feature simulates that experience using nothing but pure Python, showing how even simple logic can power impactful insights. So now the situation is that your manager is impressed with your 'People You May Know' feature and now assigns you a new challenge: Recommend pages that users might like!

On social media platforms, users interact with pages by liking, following, or engaging with posts. The goal is to analyze these interactions and suggest relevant pages based on user behavior.
